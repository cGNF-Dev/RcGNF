Author: cGNF-Team
Maintainer: Jesse Zhou <zhou.jesse2@gmail.com>
Description: This package provides a wrapper for the causal-Graphical Normalizing Flows (cGNF), 
    which focuses on answering causal questions using deep learning models based on Graphical Normalizing Flows 
    and Unconstrained Monotonic Neural Networks. The package allows users to process datasets, train models, 
    and simulate interventions and potential outcomes based on specified causal structures.
